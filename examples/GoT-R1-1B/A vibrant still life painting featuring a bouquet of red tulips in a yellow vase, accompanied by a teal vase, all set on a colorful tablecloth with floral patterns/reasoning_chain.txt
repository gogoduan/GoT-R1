A <|obj_start|>vibrant red tulip bouquet<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(36,66),(907,694)<|box_end|> is artfully arranged in a <|obj_start|>yellow vase<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(202,482),(729,964)<|box_end|>, which sits atop a <|obj_start|>tablecloth<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(0,643),(997,997)<|box_end|> adorned with a <|obj_start|>floral pattern<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(0,528),(998,995)<|box_end|>. The tulips, in full bloom, display a rich, deep red hue with tightly closed buds at the base. The vase, a glossy yellow with a smooth, slightly curved shape, contrasts vividly with the bold red of the flowers. To the right, a <|obj_start|>teal vase<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(646,449),(968,918)<|box_end|> with a narrow neck and a rounded body adds another splash of color to the composition. The arrangement is balanced, with the tulips slightly leaning towards the right, creating a sense of natural movement. The background is a neutral, soft white, which enhances the vibrancy of the flowers and the bright yellow of the vase, making them the focal point of the scene. The overall composition is simple yet striking, with the interplay of colors and textures creating a visually appealing still life.<begin_of_image>
