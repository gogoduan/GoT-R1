A <|obj_start|>vibrant still life painting<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(0,60),(997,983)<|box_end|> showcases a <|obj_start|>bouquet of red tulips<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(0,60),(698,780)<|box_end|> in a <|obj_start|>yellow vase<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(65,488),(582,982)<|box_end|>, alongside a <|obj_start|>teal vase<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(625,361),(992,887)<|box_end|>, both resting on a <|obj_start|>colorful tablecloth<|obj_end|> <|box_start|>(0,667),(997,983)<|box_end|> adorned with a floral pattern. The red tulips, with their long, slender green stems and large, open petals, are arranged in a loose, natural cluster, filling the yellow vase almost to the brim. The teal vase, positioned to the right, holds a similar arrangement of red tulips but is less full than the yellow vase. Scattered around the base of the teal vase are two additional red tulips, adding a touch of asymmetry to the composition. The background is a simple, light-colored wall with a subtle floral border, which complements the vivid colors of the flowers and vases, creating a harmonious and visually engaging scene. The overall arrangement highlights the contrast between the bright yellow and teal hues of the vases and the bold red of the tulips, while the floral tablecloth adds a delicate, soft backdrop to the lively foreground.<begin_of_image>
